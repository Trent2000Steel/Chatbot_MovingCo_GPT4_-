      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 6, 2025</p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: "24px", fontSize: "22px" }}>Deposit Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        All bookings with MovingCo require an $85 deposit to reserve your spot and secure a live MoveSafe™ Concierge Call.
        This deposit is <strong>fully refundable</strong> if you choose not to proceed after the call.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you cancel your booking <strong>before your MoveSafe™ Call</strong>, you will receive a full refund automatically within 3–5 business days.
        If you complete the call but decide not to accept the flat-rate offer, you may request a full refund by replying to your confirmation email.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: "24px", fontSize: "22px" }}>Post-Acceptance Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Once you accept the flat-rate offer and we begin shipping supplies or assigning movers, your deposit becomes non-refundable,
        as resources have been allocated to your move.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: "24px", fontSize: "22px" }}>Exchanges & Credits</h2>
      <p>
        MovingCo does not offer exchanges or store credit. However, you may reschedule your move at no additional cost up to 48 hours before your scheduled move date.
      </p>
